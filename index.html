This game used to be about a blimp, but then I forgot to rename the thing!
    
<h2>Tiny, All Powerful Sorcerer</h2>
<ul>

You are a super-powerful flying sorcerer, who is also very small. Your forest is being attacked, and you must rescue your small animal friends from evil.

<h2>Genre</h2>
Tiny, All Powerful Sorcerer would be an action game from a 2D side-view perspective.
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
	The player will control a small sorcerer, who can run and jump, and can press any one of three different keys to cast 3 different spells. One will shoot attack in a direction to kill or stun enemies, one will propel the sorcerer so they can fly, and the last can be used to lead small animals to safety. The player will aim these abilities using the mouse, and cannot use more than one at once (so flying while attacking/leading is hard). The goal of the game is to lead all the small animals back to the meadow without dying to enemies.
<h2>Features</h2>
	Pretty setting, cute animals, exciting action.
<h2>Story</h2>
	You’re a sorcerer hanging with a bunch of cute animals til some folks come in and make a big ruckus.
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
	This game is intended to reach fans of Choplifter and Luftrausers, and other 2D flying action games.
<h2>Hardware Platforms</h2>
	Anything with keyboard + mouse that can view Javascript games I guess.
<h2>Estimated Schedule</h2>
	As long as we keep low standards for every aspect of the game:
•	Art (Backgrounds, sorcerer (idle, run, fly), animals (1-2), enemies (1-2), spells (3)) 
1 week (1 person)
•	Art Implementation (Can be done at any time)
1 day
•	Sounds (Can be done at any time)
1 day in BFXR
•	Platform controls + camera
1 day – from example
•	Enemy behavior
1-3 days
•	Spells + Leading animals script
2-5 days
•	Testing/QA/Rewriting code
2-7 days
Not counting sound and art creation, which can be done by a team member in parallel to the main project, this game should* take a maximum of 18 days of hard work.
*Phaser is pretty nasty and school is exhausting, so this schedule should be taken with a grain of salt.
The animal-leading spell can be changed/removed if time isn’t permitting.
Competitive Analysis
	Game will realistically be competing with other student projects, and not with a general market of games, but other contending games will mostly be free-moving action games. These games are usually known for flashy graphics and powerful user feedback, so this game would seek to achieve the industry standard in those areas.
<h2>Team</h2>
	I do a lot of game art in my spare time (I post at @hydezeke on Twitter), so ideally I’d want to handle art. I have a lot of game coding experience, but I’m not a wizard at Phaser (or Javascript/web In general), so I’d love someone to be involved who is.
<h2>Summary</h2>
	I don’t know if the game will be great, but it will be cute. I should be the one to develop it because I have a really nice color scheme in my head and I’ll work really hard to make the game feel super good.
